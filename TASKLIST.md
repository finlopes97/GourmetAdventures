Add your contributions here! Just to keep it simple, don't
worry about using any fancy markdown styling, just write something
like:

---

* Task: Landing Page  
* Date Completed: 18/05/2023  
* Completed By: Kyle  
* Brief: Worked on the HTML templates  

---

The horizontal lines "---" are just to add some whitespace between 
contributions so the file is more readable, same for the asterisks "*"
on a new-line. This example will be deleted at the end, so place 
your contributions under the heading below.
