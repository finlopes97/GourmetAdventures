# Complete Solution for Event Management System

## Gitequitte
1. You should almost always create a new branch for any work you do.
2. Use groups to classify your branches, groups being:
   * bugfix 
   * feature 
   And any additional groups we may require can be added.
3. When naming branches use the convention "group-description-of-branch". 
   An example is "bugfix-header-size-issue"
4. Try to post a message letting the team know when you push a commit
   using Discord or some other means so we can check it out and 
   update our local repos.
5. When you work on an issue on the project tracker, and finish the 
   task that was set, please close the issue. 
6. When you finish a task, try to keep the TASKLIST.md updated. 
7. Please don't delete the main branch ðŸ«¥
